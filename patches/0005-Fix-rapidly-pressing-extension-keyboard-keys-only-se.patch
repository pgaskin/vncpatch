Subject: [PATCH 5/5] Fix rapidly pressing extension keyboard keys only sending
 half

The existing logic handles double-taps separately. It used to send a
single keypress if the key isn't a lockable modifier, but this is
obviously buggy since a double-tap is actually two presses.

Updating:
- Diff the KeyboardKey class to ensure the method names are up-to-date.
- Test to ensure rapidly pressing extension keys works correctly.
